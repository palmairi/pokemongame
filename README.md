Pokemon Memory Card Game

About the project
-----------
This is a fun implementation of a classic memory game, in which you need to find the pairs.
The project was created using `ReactJS and SCSS`.

**The features are the following:**
* You can choose your deck size (5-7-9 pairs)
* You can restart the game
* You can change the difficulty while playing


**Features incoming as I am currently refining this project:**
* Timer
* Scoring
* Save your progress
* Step counter
* Winner screen (probably shareable to show to your friends)


For running this project you need to do the following steps:
1. Clone the project from Github
2. npm i
3. npm run start (on localhost:3000)
